## Syntax

```sql
UPDATE <table_name> SET <col1> = <expr1> [, <col2> = <expr2> ...] WHERE <condition>
```

| Parameter | Description|
| :---------| :----------|
| `<table_name>`| The table to update rows in. |
| `<col>`       | Name of the column to be updated. |
| `<expr>`      | Expression which computes new value to populate the column. It can reference any column from the row being updated.
| `<condition>` | A Boolean expression. Only rows for which this expression returns `true` will be updated. Condition can have subqueries doing semijoin with other table(s). |

### Example with WHERE

Apply discount for products which have excessive inventory.

```sql
UPDATE product SET price = price * 0.9 WHERE quantity > 10
```

Table before:

```
product
+------------+--------+----------+
| name       | price  | quantity |
+---------------------+----------+
| wand       |    120 |        9 |
| broomstick |    270 |       15 |
| robe       |     80 |        1 |
| cauldron   |     20 |      112 |
+------------+--------+----------+
```

Table after:

```
product
+------------+--------+----------+
| name       | price  | quantity |
+---------------------+----------+
| wand       |    120 |        9 |
| broomstick |    243 |       15 |
| robe       |     80 |        1 |
| cauldron   |     18 |      112 |
+------------+--------+----------+
```

### Example updating multiple columns

Apply discount for products which have excessive inventory.

```sql
UPDATE product SET price = 15, quantity = 100 WHERE name = 'quaffle'
```

Table before:

```
product
+------------+--------+----------+
| name       | price  | quantity |
+---------------------+----------+
| wand       |    120 |        9 |
| broomstick |    270 |       15 |
| quaffle    |        |          |
| robe       |     80 |        1 |
| cauldron   |     20 |      112 |
+------------+--------+----------+
```

Table after:

```
product
+------------+--------+----------+
| name       | price  | quantity |
+---------------------+----------+
| wand       |    120 |        9 |
| broomstick |    270 |       15 |
| quaffle    |     15 |      100 |
| robe       |     80 |        1 |
| cauldron   |     20 |      112 |
+------------+--------+----------+
```

### Known limitations

Below are some known limitations of the `UPDATE` command in the alpha release. 

* Only one `UPDATE` will be executed against a table at once.

* `UPDATE` cannot be used on tables that have certain aggregating indexes, or join indexes. It can be used on tables that have aggregating indexes containing the following aggregating functions, starting in **DB version 3.16.0:**
  * [COUNT and COUNT(DISTINCT)](../sql-reference/functions-reference/count.md)
  * [SUM](../sql-reference/functions-reference/sum.md)
  * [AVG](../sql-reference/functions-reference/avg.md)
  * [PERCENTILE_CONT](../sql-reference/functions-reference/percentile-cont.md)
  * [PERCENTILE_DIST](../sql-reference/functions-reference/percentile-dist.md)
  * [NEST/ARRAY_AGG]((../sql-reference/functions-reference/nest.md))

* `UPDATE` cannot be used on tables that have aggregating indexes containing other aggregating functions than the ones listed above. An attempt to issue a `UPDATE` statement on a table with a join index or aggregating index outside of the above defined fails. In order for `UPDATE` to succeed, table level aggregating or join indexes need to be dropped.

* `DISTINCT` only works with `COUNT` â€“ i.e. `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, but not `SUM(DISTINCT)` currently.
