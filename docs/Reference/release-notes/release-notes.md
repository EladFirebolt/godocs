Firebolt might roll out releases in phases. New features and changes may not yet be available to all accounts on the release date shown.

## DB version 3.29
**October 2023**

* [New features](#new-features)
* [Enhancements, changes, and new integrations](#enhancements-changes-and-new-integrations)

### New features

<!--- FIR-25082 ---> **EXPLAIN ANALYZE now available for detailed query metrics**

You can now use the [EXPLAIN command](../../sql_reference/commands/queries/explain.md) to execute `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) <select statement>` and get detailed metrics about how much time is spent on each operator in the query plan, and how much data is processed. The query plan shown there is the physical query plan, which you can inspect using `EXPLAIN (PHYSICAL) <select statement>` without executing the query. It shows how query processing is distributed over the nodes of an engine.


### Enhancements, changes and new integrations

<!--- FIR-25636 ---> **PERCENTILE_CONT and PERCENTILE_DISC now return PostgreSQL-compliant results**

[PERCENTILE_CONT](../../sql_reference/functions-reference/window/percentile-cont-window.md) for decimal input now returns DOUBLE PRECISION instead of NUMERIC data type. 

<!--- FIR-24362 ---> **Virtual column 'source_file_timestamp' uses new data type**

The virtual column `source_file_timestamp` has been migrated from the data type `TIMESTAMP` (legacy timestamp type without time zone) to the type `TIMESTAMPTZ` (new timestamp type with time zone).

Despite the increased resolution, the data is still in second precision as AWS S3 provides them only as unix seconds.

Use `source_file_timestamp - NOW()` instead of `DATE_DIFF('second', source_file_timestamp, NOW())`

<!--- FIR-10514 ---> **New function added**

A new alias `ARRAY_TO_STRING` has been added to function [ARRAY_JOIN](../../sql_reference/functions-reference/array/array-join.md).
