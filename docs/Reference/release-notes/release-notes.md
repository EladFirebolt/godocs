# Release notes

Firebolt continuously releases updates so that you have access to the latest and most stable product. While these updates might occur daily, but we consolidate release notes over a longer time period for your convenience. The following are the release notes from the latest version.

- See the [Release notes archive](../release-notes/release-notes-archive.md) for release notes from earlier versions.

{: .note}
Firebolt may deploy releases in phases, meaning that new features and changes may not be immediately available to all accounts on the specified release date.
