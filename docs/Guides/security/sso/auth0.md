# Auth0

#### Configure Auth0 application

1. In the Auth0 Admin Console, navigate to **Applications > Applications** in the lefthand bar
2. Click **Create Application**. 
3. Specify a name for your Application. **Select Regular Web Application** as the Application Type. Click **Create the Application**
4. Once created, **Navigate to the Settings Page**. **Scroll down to the Application URIs** section. 
5. In the Application Login URI field, **Provide a Login URI** by entering your Firebolt Org Address, followed by ```/login?```. For example, ```https://staging-go.firebolt.io/login?```
6. In the Allowed Callback URLs field, **Provide a Callback URL**. The URL has the following format: `https://id.app.firebolt.io/login/callback?connection=<org_name>-<provider>&organization=<organization_identifier>`. For example, `https://id.app.firebolt.io/login/callback?connection=firebolt-staging-auth0&organization=org_UJhpsQ5ypXVU8JVB`

    > **`<org_name>`** represents the Organizational name used to create your Firebolt Account. The org name is referenced in your vanity URL.  
    > **`<provider>`** represents the provider we're configuring as our IdP. In this case, it's Auth0.  
    > **`<organization_identifier>`** is the unique identifier for your Organization. To retrieve your **`<organization_identifier>`**, you can navigate to **Configure > SSO** in the Firebolt UI, and **Click Copy organization SSO identifier**. 


7. Save the Configuration. Scroll back up & navigate to the **Addons Page**.
8. Under Addons, toggle **SAML2 WEB APP** 
9. In the pop-up modal, under Usage, take note of the ```Identity Provider Login URL``` &  download the Identity Provider Certificate. These will be needed when configuring Firebolt to work with your Auth0 IdP.
10. In the pop-up modal, Navigate to Settings. Scroll all the way down and click Enable to enable the SSO via SAML2.0 on the IdP.
11. You can now configure Firebolt to use Auth0 as your IdP. 

#### Configure Firebolt 
Once your Identity Provider(IdP) is configured, you can now configure Firebolt to integrate with your IdP. This can be done via the Firebolt UI, or via SQL.

##### UI
1. To configure the Firebolt SSO integration with Auth0 via the UI, Navigate to **Configure > SSO** in Firebolt. 

2. Once there, enter your Sign-on URL, Issuer, Provider, Label, Certificate, and field-mappings, where 

- ```signOnUrl```: The sign-on URL, provided by the SAML identity provider, to which Firebolt sends the SAML requests. The URL is IdP-specific and is determined by the identity provider during configuration. For Auth0, this value is the Identity Provider Login URL value copied earlier ([during Auth0 setup](#auth0))
- ```signoutUrl(optional)```: The sign-out URL, provided by the application owner, to be used when the user signs out of the application.```
- ```issuer```: A unique value generated by the SAML identity provider specifying the issuer value.
- ```provider```: The provider's name - for example: ```Auth0```. 
- ```label```: The label to use for the SSO login button. If not provided, the Provider field value is used. 
- ```certificate```: The certificate to verify the communication between the identity provider and Firebolt. The certificate needs to be in PEM or CER format, and can be uploaded from your computer by choosing **Import certificate** or entered in the text box.
- ```field mapping```: Mapping to your identity provider's first and last name in key-value pairs. If additional fields are required, choose **Add another key-value pair**. Mapping is required for Firebolt to fill in the login’s given and last names the first time the user logs in using SSO. 
      Here’s an example of how to set up field mapping:

      ```json  
        {
            "given_name": "name",
            "family_name": "surname"
        }
      ```

      where the "given_name" (first name) is mapped to the "name" field from the IDP, and the "family_name" (last name) is mapped from the "surname" field.
3. Choose **Update changes**

##### SQL

To create your SSO connection in Firebolt, you can use the following SQL as an example:
```sql
ALTER ORGANIZATION vsko SET SSO = '{
  "signOnUrl": "https://dev-a8jnpkgk4y7gylt5.us.auth0.com/samlp/9aLOXgDHcqxW1gWtBuWNxVLbKNyv1LQV",
  "issuer": "auth0",
  "provider": "auth0",
  "label": "Auth0 Company IdP",
  "fieldMapping": {
    "given_name": "name",
    "family_name": "surname"
  },
  "certificate": "<certificate>",
}';
```

where
- ```signOnUrl```: The sign-on URL, provided by the SAML identity provider, to which Firebolt sends the SAML requests. The URL is IdP-specific and is determined by the identity provider during configuration. For Auth0, this value is the Identity Provider Login URL value copied earlier ([during Auth0 setup](#auth0))
- ```signoutUrl(optional)```: The sign-out URL, provided by the application owner, to be used when the user signs out of the application.```
- ```issuer```: A unique value generated by the SAML identity provider specifying the issuer value.
- ```provider```: The provider's name - for example: ```Auth0```. 
- ```label```: The label to use for the SSO login button. If not provided, the Provider field value is used. 
- ```certificate```: The certificate to verify the communication between the identity provider and Firebolt. The certificate needs to be in PEM or CER format, and can be uploaded from your computer by choosing **Import certificate** or entered in the text box.
- ```field mapping```: Mapping to your identity provider's first and last name in key-value pairs. If additional fields are required, choose **Add another key-value pair**. Mapping is required for Firebolt to fill in the login’s given and last names the first time the user logs in using SSO. 
      Here’s an example of how to set up field mapping:

      ```json  
        {
            "given_name": "name",
            "family_name": "surname"
        }
      ```

      where the "given_name" (first name) is mapped to the "name" field from the IDP, and the "family_name" (last name) is mapped from the "surname" field.
