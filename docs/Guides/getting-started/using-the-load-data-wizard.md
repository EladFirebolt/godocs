## Using the Load data wizard
{:.no_toc}

The **Load data** wizard guides you through creating a database and engine, and loading data from an Amazon S3 bucket. You can specify basic configurations including what character to use as a file delimiter, which columns to import and their schema. After you load your data, continue your workflow in the SQL workspace to run and optimize a query, and export to an external table. Even though the **Load data** wizard creates a database and engine for you, the following [**Create a Database**](#create-a-database) and [**Create an Engine**](#create-an-engine) sections in this guide contain general information about billing for engine runtime and schema. 

To use the **Load data** wizard, you can select the plus (+) icon next to **Databases** in the left navigation pane and select **Load data**.  For detailed information about how to use the Load data wizard, see [Load data](../Guides/loading-data/loading-data.md).
