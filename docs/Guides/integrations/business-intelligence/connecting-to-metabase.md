[Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) is an open source business intelligence tool used for exploring data and producing dashboards.

If you are using Metabase Cloud, you can skip to [Creating a connection](#creating-a-connection) below; no download or installation is necessary.

### Setting up the Firebolt connector (on-premises only)

To set up the Firebolt connector on a self-hosted Metabase instance, download the following files and save them to the `/plugins` directory on your Metabase host system. By default, `/plugins` is a subdirectory of the directory where the `metabase.jar` file executes.

To set up the Firebolt connector on a self-hosted Metabase instance:
1. Download the latest Firebolt Metabase driver from its [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/firebolt-db/metabase-firebolt-driver/releases).
2. Move the driver to the `/plugins` directory on your Metabase host system. By default, `/plugins` is a subdirectory of the directory where the `metabase.jar` file executes.

### Creating a connection

You are now ready to run Metabase with your Firebolt databases.

1. Use a web browser to navigate to the home page of your Metabase instance.
